# Weather Dashboard
When creating this app my motivation was to show the power and amazing things that server-side APIs, Javascript, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML have when working together. You can connect so many different sources of information to run through your site, the options are endless. 

In this example I used an open weather map API to showcase a weather dashboard with a live daily forecast and a five day forecast consisting of properties such as the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index (predicted at 12:00pm on each day). As well as the capibilites to search whatever city the user is interested in getting the weather for. It also has functions such as local storage to add searched cities to the search history as well as an event listener to present the selected city clicked in the search history. Additionally, if the user closes the window or refreshes the browser, the search history buttons remain, and the app will open up with the weather results for the last city the user searched for. 

I built this project to help anyone interested in searching for weather in whatever desired city they choose. I learned how amazing Bootstrap can be in terms of layout and different functions it offers, and how Javascript can really help to make an amazing server-side API website that can be helpful to so many people when powered together.
